		<h4>Want to know about us? It’s a simple story.</h4>
		<p>We’re just a pair of novice coding students,<br>
		slowly (but surely) figuring out how<br>
		to get our computers to work with GitHub.</p>

		<h5>Wins of the day so far…</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>We now both have Node installed</li>
			<li>We both (probably *fingers crossed*)<br>
			have Git set up properly with out operating<br>
			systems</li>
		</ul>

		<h5>Blockers of the day so far…</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>We both felt some stress from being slightly<br>
			behind and getting a later start on our lab work</li>
			<li>We were only able to observe Alex’s demos<br>
			during lecture rather than recreating them in<br>
			real-time</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Be sure to check back in with us<br>
		closer to the end of the week!<br>
		We should have a better handle<br>
		on things by then [insert nervous emoji here].</p>
